# Nmap Scan Integration

## Purpose
- To perform port scanning and service enumeration.

## Python Implementation
- **Library:** Use the `python-nmap` library, a Python wrapper for Nmap.
- **Execution:** Script executes Nmap scans on the target domain (e.g., itsecgames.com) to identify open ports and services.

## Data Extraction
- **Details:** Extract information like open ports, service names, and versions.

# Tshark Packet Analysis Integration

## Purpose
- To analyze network traffic patterns.

## Python Implementation
- **Tool:** Utilize `subprocess` module to run Tshark commands.
- **Analysis:** Tshark, the command-line version of Wireshark, captures and analyzes packets.

## Data Extraction
- **Details:** Capture total packets, analyze traffic patterns, and identify anomalies or unusual traffic.

# Report Generation

## Content
- The script compiles findings from both Nmap and Tshark analyses into a structured report format.

## Python Implementation
- **Template:** Use a text template for the report, filling in dynamic content like scan results, traffic analysis, and compliance assessment.
- **Library:** Employ libraries like `jinja2` for templating.

# Compliance Assessment

## Purpose
- To assess compliance with specified standards (e.g., ISO 27001, NIST, PCI DSS).

## Python Implementation
- **Logic:** Implement logic to compare scan findings against compliance checklists or criteria.
- **Data Requirement:** Predefined dataset or rules for compliance for each standard.

# Recommendations and Action Plan

## Purpose
- To provide actionable security recommendations based on the findings.

## Python Implementation
- **Heuristics:** Develop rules or heuristics suggesting actions based on specific types of vulnerabilities or misconfigurations found.

# Automation and Execution Flow

- **Flow:** Run Nmap scan ➡️ Process output ➡️ Run Tshark analysis ➡️ Compile results into audit report.
- **User Input:** Accept inputs like target domain and compliance standards through command-line arguments.

# Error Handling and Logging

- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for issues during scans or analysis.
- **Logging:** Include logging functionalities to track the script's progress and any encountered issues.
