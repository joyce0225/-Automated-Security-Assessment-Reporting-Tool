# Automated Security Assessment Reporting Tool

## Project Overview
This tool is designed to automate the process of network scanning and vulnerability assessment by leveraging open-source security tools. It simplifies the steps from scanning a network to generating a comprehensive security report, making the process efficient and user-friendly.

## Objective
The main goal is to create an automated solution to identify vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in systems or networks and generate an easy-to-read report that details the findings.

## Approach
- Utilize open-source tools such as Nmap, OpenVAS, and Wireshark for scanning and analysis.
- Develop a Python script to run these tools, collect outputs, and parse them into a structured format.
- Implement a reporting mechanism to convert parsed data into a comprehensive report, potentially including summaries, graphs, and action items.

## Technologies Used
- **Nmap**: Network scanning
- **Wireshark**: Packet analysis
- **Python**: Scripting and automation
- **Gnuplot/Matplotlib**: Data visualization
- **LaTeX/Markdown**: Report generation
